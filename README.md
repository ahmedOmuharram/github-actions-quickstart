**Feedback on the [Quickstart for GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/quickstart) doc**:

"This guide is wonderfully detailed and approachable, offering clear, step-by-step instructions that make setting up a GitHub Actions workflow accessible even to beginners. One improvement could be to expand on the different trigger options—explaining alternatives to on: [push], such as on: [pull_request] or scheduled triggers—so that newcomers can better understand how to tailor workflows to their specific needs."
